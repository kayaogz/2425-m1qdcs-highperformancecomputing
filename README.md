Text editor: If you do not have a "preferred" text editor for development already, I recommend the Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com

Installing Ubuntu on Windows using WSL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjbbl0TTMeo

Installing Homebrew on Mac: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWJKRmFLn-g

Installing GCC using Homebrew: brew install gcc

To compile using GCC, you should use the command gcc-14 instead of gcc (which defaults to clang compiler that does not come with OpenMP)
